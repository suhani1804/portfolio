Structures are the way to define multiple datatypes into a single datatype or basically grouping multiple datatypes togather.

- How to define a structure ?

struct myStruct{
int a;
float b;
char c[30]; // String array of char
};

- Here int a and float b are called the value of structures.

- How to access and assign value to the "member of stucture" ?

- Firstly we have to define a variable of myStruct datatype and then we can access its members using dot(.) operator.

int main {

struct myStruct m1;
m1.a = 10;
m1.b =18.5;
printf("%d %f",m1.a, m1.b);

}

- The problem with assignment to string members in strcut ?
  - Actually string are the array of characters and we can cant assign value to them directly ?
  
int main (){

struct myStruct m1;
m1.c = "Shashank"; // this will give an error.

}

  - Then how to resolve this error ? We can use strcpy() method for the assignment to string struct members.
strcpy(m1.c, "Shashank");

- A simple syntax for defining and assiging values to struct variables in a single line.

struct myStruct m1 = {30, 17.5, "Shashank"};

- In the above declaration, to assign the string, we do not need the strcpy method, it can be assigned directly.

- Copy the structures
 - Struct variables can be copied onto eachother.

struct myStruct m1;
m1.int = 10;
struct myStrcut m2;
m2 = m1;
